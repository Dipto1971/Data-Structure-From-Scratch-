/*A queue or FIFO (first in, first out) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of
elements, with two principal operations: enqueue, the process of adding an element to
the collection.(The element is added from the rear side) and dequeue, the process of
removing the first element that was added. (The element is removed from the front
side). It can be implemented by using both array and linked list.

Queue is used when things donâ€™t have to be processed immediately but have to be
processed in First in First out order. This property of Queue makes it also useful in
following kind of scenarios.*/
