/*Stack:
A stack is an Abstract Data Type (ADT), commonly used in most programming languages. It is
named stack as it behaves like a real-world stack, for example â€“ a deck of cards or a pile of
plates, etc. A real-world stack allows operations at one end only. This feature makes it LIFO data
structure. In stack terminology, insertion operation is called PUSH operation and removal
operation is called POP operation.*/

/*Question:
Exercise 1:
Create a menu that will display all the exercises given below (Exercise 2 to Exercise 5) as a list
and prompt user to select any desired option. The menu can be designed in below format.
-> Exercise 2:
Push Operation
Adding a new data/node in stack is a more than one step activity. First, create a node using
structure and find the location where it has to be inserted. Then input the data and store it in
the allocated memory space. Insert the node at the beginning of the previously inserted node.
-> Exercise 3:
Pop Operation
After completing exercise 1 you have a newly created stack. Now perform the pop operation on
it.
-> Exercise 4:
Parsing Unmatched Parenthesis
One of the most important applications of stack is parsing. Parsing is any logic that breaks data
into independent piece for further processing. So parsing unmatched parenthesis is a common
problem of parsing. When parentheses are unmatched then there will be two types of error:
the opening parenthesis is unmatched or the closing parenthesis is missing.
Write a program using stack that will make sure that all parentheses are well paried.
-> Exercise 5:
Reversing Data
Reversing data requires that a given set of data be reordered so that the first and last elements
are exchanged. The idea of reversing data can be used in solving classical problem such as
converting a decimal number to a binary number. Now write a program using stack that will
convert decimal number to binary number.*/
