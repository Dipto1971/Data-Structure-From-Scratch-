Exercise 1:
Insert Operation
If we build a heap then we add a new key at the end of the tree. IF we want to build min heap
then if new key is greater than its parent, then we donâ€™t need to do anything. Otherwise, we
need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.
Exercise 2:
Deletion Operation
Perform deletion operation of Binary Heap
Exercise 3:
Smallest and Largest Element
Find maximum and minimum element from Heap
Exercise 4:
Heap Sort
Write a program that will sort given list of data using Heap Sort algorithm.
