Factorial:
The factorial of a non-negative integer 'n' is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to 'n'. It is denoted by 'n!' For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

gcd (Greatest Common Divisor) and lcm (Least Common Multiple):
gcd is the largest positive integer that divides two or more numbers without leaving a remainder. lcm is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of two or more numbers. You can find gcd and lcm using standard algorithms like Euclid's algorithm.

Fibonacci Sequence:
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. For example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

Sum of Array Elements:
To find the sum of elements in an array, you can loop through each element and accumulate the sum.

Sum of Digits:
To find the sum of digits of a number, you can extract each digit and add them together.

Product of Digits:
To find the product of digits of a number, you can extract each digit and multiply them together.

Power Function:
Implementing a power function involves raising a number to a given exponent. You can use a recursive approach or an iterative approach to calculate the result.

Reverse a Number:
To reverse a number, you can extract each digit and build the reversed number.

Palindrome Check:
A number or string is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forwards.

Count Zero:
To count the number of zeros in a given number, you can extract each digit and check if it's zero.

Permutations:
Permutations are all possible arrangements of a set of elements. For example, given "abc," the permutations would be "abc," "acb," "bac," "bca," "cab," and "cba."

Combination Sum:
Finding combinations that sum up to a specific target from a set of numbers.

Reverse a Linked List:
Reversing the order of elements in a linked list.

Tower of Hanoi:
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle involving moving disks from one peg to another with the help of an auxiliary peg, following certain rules.
