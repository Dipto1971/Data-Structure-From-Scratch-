# Dynamic Table Management System

This C++ program is designed to help you create and manage dynamic tables with ease. It offers various functionalities for manipulating tables, including adding topics (columns), inserting data, deleting topics and data, displaying tables, saving data to files, and loading data from files. Below is a detailed guide on how to use this program and potential future improvements.

## How to Use

1. **Compile and Run the Program**
   - Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
   - Compile the program by running your compiler's command (e.g., `g++ -o dynamic_table dynamic_table.cpp`).
   - Execute the program (e.g., `./dynamic_table`).

2. **Main Menu**
   - Upon running, you'll see a menu with various options. Here's what each option does:

     1. **Insert Topic**: Add a new column (topic) to the table.
     2. **Insert Data**: Insert data into the table at a specified row and column.
     3. **Delete Topic**: Delete a column (topic) and its corresponding data.
     4. **Delete Data**: Delete specific data at a given row and column.
     5. **Delete Row**: Remove an entire row and its data.
     6. **Display Table**: View the table in a tabular format.
     7. **Display Topics**: Display the column names (topics) with keys.
     8. **Enter Specific Data for All Rows**: Quickly populate the table with data.
     9. **Save Data to File**: Save the current table to a text file.
     10. **Load Data from File**: Load previously saved data from a file.
     11. **Quit**: Exit the program.

3. **Functionality Instructions**
   - Follow the prompts and input instructions to perform each operation.
   - Topics (columns) and data (rows) can be named and manipulated dynamically.

4. **Data Storage**
   - Data is saved to and loaded from a file named "data.txt" by default. You can change the filename in the `main` function.

## Future Improvements

To make this program more robust and feature-rich, consider these potential future improvements:

1. **User Authentication**: Implement user authentication to control access to data. Users can have different levels of access rights.

2. **Data Validation**: Enhance data input validation to handle invalid inputs more gracefully.

3. **Undo/Redo Functionality**: Implement undo and redo functionality to allow users to revert changes.

4. **Database Integration**: Integrate with a database system for better data management, scalability, and persistence.

5. **Support Data Types**: Add support for different data types (e.g., strings, dates) in addition to integers.

6. **GUI Interface**: Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier interaction with the program.

7. **Search and Filter**: Add search and filter capabilities to find specific data within the table.

8. **Data Visualization**: Provide options to generate charts and graphs based on the table's data.

9. **Concurrency Control**: Implement concurrency control mechanisms to handle simultaneous access by multiple users.

10. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve error handling to provide more informative messages to users.

11. **Data Export**: Allow users to export data to various file formats (e.g., CSV, Excel).

12. **Data Import**: Enable data import from external sources (e.g., CSV files).

Remember that the choice of improvements depends on the specific use case and requirements of the dynamic table management system. Feel free to adapt and expand the program to meet your needs.
