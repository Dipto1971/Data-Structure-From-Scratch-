Question a:
A bus company uses the formula shown below to determine the priority of passengers on the waiting list 
for providing ticket on later schedule.
Priority number = (A/10) + B – C
Where A is the customer’s total mileage in the past year by their bus, B is the number of years in his/her 
frequent travel and C is a sequence number representing the customer’s arrival position when he/she booked 
the bus ticket. Given a file of overbooked customers in below table, determine each customer’s priority 
number where the largest priority number will have the highest priority and build a Binary Heap using the 
priority number.
|   Name   | Mileage (A) | Years (B) | Sequence (C) |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
|   Rony   |     930     |     4     |       1       |
|   Jack    |     1240    |     3     |       2       |
|   Smith  |     830     |     3     |       3       |
|   Paul    |     370     |     2     |       4       |
|  Sophia |     720     |     4     |       5       |
|   Jorge  |     650     |     2     |       6       |


-> Solution: 

Calculate the priority number for each customer:
- Rony: Priority number = (930/10) + 4 - 1 = 93 + 4 - 1 = 96
- Jack: Priority number = (1240/10) + 3 - 2 = 124 + 3 - 2 = 125
- Smith: Priority number = (830/10) + 3 - 3 = 83 + 3 - 3 = 83
- Paul: Priority number = (370/10) + 2 - 4 = 37 + 2 - 4 = 35
- Sophia: Priority number = (720/10) + 4 - 5 = 72 + 4 - 5 = 71
- Jorge: Priority number = (650/10) + 2 - 6 = 65 + 2 - 6 = 61

Create a Binary Heap and insert each customer's name and priority number:

Binary Heap:
                         125 (Jack)
                       /            \
                96 (Rony)           83 (Smith)
                /       \             /  
       71 (Sophia)     61 (Jorge)  35 (Paul)

 Organize the Binary Heap:
In a Binary Heap, the root should have the highest priority. If it doesn't, you'll need to perform a heapify operation to reorganize the heap.

In this case, the heap is already organized correctly since Jack has the highest priority (125). No further action is needed.

The Binary Heap is now built with customers ordered by priority, with the customer having the highest priority at the root (Jack) and the customer having the lowest priority at the bottom (Paul).





Question b: Now consider four customers have cancelled their booked ticket and the bus company has decided to 
provide the available ticket to top four customers from the waiting list constructed in question no 1(a) 
according to their priority number. Delete the top four priority customer from the Heap and perform 
necessary operations to rebuild the heap after each deletion. 

1-> Delete the top priority customer (Jack) and rebuild the heap:

       96 (Rony)
      /         \
71 (Sophia)      83 (Smith)
   /       \
61 (Jorge) 35 (Paul)


2-> Delete the new top priority customer (Rony) and rebuild the heap:

       83 (Smith)
      /          \
71 (Sophia)      35 (Paul)
   /       
 61 (Jorge) 


3-> Delete the new top priority customer (Smith) and rebuild the heap:

       71 (Sophia)
      /          \
61 (Jorge)      35 (Paul)


4-> Delete the final top priority customer (Sophia) and rebuild the heap:

       61 (Jorge)
      /  
   35 (Paul)
