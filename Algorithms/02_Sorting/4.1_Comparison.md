Let’s use an example to demonstrate **Insertion Sort** and explain why it is efficient for small datasets. We'll sort the following array:

### Initial Array:

\[ 8, 4, 6, 2, 9 \]

---

### Step-by-Step Process:

#### **Step 1: Start with the Second Element**

- The first element, **8**, is already "sorted" in its position.
- Take the second element, **4**, as the key and compare it with the elements in the sorted portion:
  - Compare **4** with **8**. Since **4** is smaller, move **8** one position to the right.
  - Insert **4** in the vacated position.

**Array After Step 1**:  
\[ 4, 8, 6, 2, 9 \]

---

#### **Step 2: Move to the Third Element**

- Take the third element, **6**, as the key and compare it with the sorted portion \[4, 8\]:
  - Compare **6** with **8**. Since **6** is smaller, move **8** one position to the right.
  - Compare **6** with **4**. Since **6** is larger, place it after **4**.

**Array After Step 2**:  
\[ 4, 6, 8, 2, 9 \]

---

#### **Step 3: Move to the Fourth Element**

- Take the fourth element, **2**, as the key and compare it with the sorted portion \[4, 6, 8\]:
  - Compare **2** with **8**. Since **2** is smaller, move **8** one position to the right.
  - Compare **2** with **6**. Since **2** is smaller, move **6** one position to the right.
  - Compare **2** with **4**. Since **2** is smaller, move **4** one position to the right.
  - Insert **2** in the vacated position.

**Array After Step 3**:  
\[ 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 \]

---

#### **Step 4: Move to the Fifth Element**

- Take the fifth element, **9**, as the key and compare it with the sorted portion \[2, 4, 6, 8\]:
  - Compare **9** with **8**. Since **9** is larger, leave it in its current position.

**Array After Step 4**:  
\[ 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 \]

---

### Final Sorted Array:

\[ 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 \]

---

### Why Insertion Sort is Efficient for This Example:

1. **Small Dataset**:

   - The array has only 5 elements. For such a small dataset, the simplicity of Insertion Sort outweighs the additional overhead that more complex algorithms, like Merge Sort or Quick Sort, introduce.

2. **Adaptive Nature**:

   - The sorted portion of the array grows incrementally. If the array were nearly sorted (e.g., \[2, 4, 6, 8, 9\]), very few comparisons and no swaps would be needed.

3. **Few Comparisons and Swaps**:

   - In this example, the algorithm made a total of 7 comparisons and 6 swaps. These numbers are relatively low, especially for a dataset of this size.

4. **In-Place Sorting**:
   - The algorithm doesn’t require extra space for temporary arrays or recursion stacks, making it memory-efficient.

### Visual Summary of Efficiency:

| Step | Comparisons | Swaps | Sorted Portion    |
| ---- | ----------- | ----- | ----------------- |
| 1    | 1           | 1     | \[4, 8\]          |
| 2    | 2           | 1     | \[4, 6, 8\]       |
| 3    | 3           | 3     | \[2, 4, 6, 8\]    |
| 4    | 1           | 0     | \[2, 4, 6, 8, 9\] |

---

### Conclusion:

For this small dataset, Insertion Sort quickly sorts the array with minimal comparisons and swaps, while maintaining low memory usage. The simplicity of the algorithm allows it to efficiently handle datasets of this scale, making it a preferred choice in such scenarios.
