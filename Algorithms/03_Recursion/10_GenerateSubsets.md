1. **Initialization**:

   - We start with the main function where the string `s` is initialized with "abc".
   - We call the `generateSubsets` function with the parameters `s` (the original string), an empty string `""` (initially for the subset), and `0` (starting index).

2. **Recursive Calls**:

   - Inside the `generateSubsets` function:
     - For each character in the string `s`, we have two recursive calls.
       - The first call does not include the current character (`s[i]`), so `current` remains unchanged.
       - The second call includes the current character (`s[i]`) by appending it to `current`.
     - We recursively call `generateSubsets` for the next index (`i+1`) until `i` reaches the length of the string.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When `i` becomes equal to the length of the string, we print the current subset.

Let's visualize the process:

```
s = "abc"
generateSubsets(s, "", 0)

                             ("", 0)
                    /                    \
             ("", 1)                      ("a", 1)
        /          \                   /            \
   ("", 2)        ("b", 2)         ("a", 2)       ("ab", 2)
    /     \        /     \         /     \        /     \
("", 3) ("c", 3) ("b", 3) ("bc", 3) ("a", 3) ("ac", 3) ("ab", 3) ("abc", 3)
```

In the visualization:

- Each level of the tree represents a recursive call with a specific index `i`.
- Each branch represents a decision whether to include the character at index `i` in the subset or not.
- The base case is reached when `i` equals the length of the string, and the current subset is printed.
- The tree expands recursively until all subsets are generated.
