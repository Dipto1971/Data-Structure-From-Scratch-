Sure, let's go through the code and build the table step by step:

1. The code defines a function `countSubsets` which takes an array `arr[]`, its size `n`, and a target sum `sum` as input parameters. This function calculates the number of subsets of the array `arr[]` that sum up to the given `sum`.

2. Inside the `countSubsets` function:
   - It initializes a 2D array `dp[][]` of size `(n+1) x (sum+1)` to store the intermediate results.
   - Initializes `dp[i][0] = 1` for all `0 <= i <= n`, indicating that there is always one subset (empty subset) with a sum of 0.
   - Initializes `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `1 <= j <= sum`, indicating that there are no subsets of the empty set that sum up to a non-zero value.

3. Then, it iterates through the array `arr[]` and the sum `sum` using two nested loops:
   - For each element in the array (`arr[i - 1]`), and for each possible sum (`j`) from 1 to `sum`, it calculates `dp[i][j]`.
   - If `arr[i - 1]` is less than or equal to `j`, it means we can either include or exclude `arr[i - 1]` in the subset. So, `dp[i][j]` is the sum of the number of subsets obtained by including `arr[i - 1]` and excluding `arr[i - 1]`.
   - If `arr[i - 1]` is greater than `j`, it means we can't include `arr[i - 1]` in the subset. So, `dp[i][j]` is equal to the number of subsets obtained by excluding `arr[i - 1]`.

4. Finally, it returns `dp[n][sum]`, which represents the total number of subsets of `arr[]` that sum up to `sum`.

Now, let's build the table for the given example with `arr[] = {2, 5, 3}` and `sum = 5`:

```
   | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
 2 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
 3 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 2 |
```

In this table:
- Rows represent the indices of elements in the array `arr[]`, including the empty subset (row 0).
- Columns represent possible sums from 0 to the target `sum`.
- Each cell `dp[i][j]` represents the number of subsets of the subarray `arr[0..i-1]` that sum up to `j`.

For example, `dp[3][5] = 2`, which means there are 2 subsets of the array `{2, 5, 3}` that sum up to 5, which are `{2, 3}` and `{5}`.
