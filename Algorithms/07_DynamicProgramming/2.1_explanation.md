1. **Initialization**: The function `knapsack` initializes a 2D array `dp[][]` to store the maximum value that can be obtained with the first `i` items and a knapsack capacity of `w`.

2. **Nested Loop**: The nested loop iterates over each item and each possible capacity of the knapsack.

3. **Base Case**: If there are no items (`i == 0`) or the capacity of the knapsack is 0 (`w == 0`), the value is 0 because no items can be selected.

4. **Choice**: If the weight of the current item is less than or equal to the current capacity (`wt[i - 1] <= w`), then we have two choices:
   - Include the current item: `val[i - 1] + dp[i - 1][w - wt[i - 1]]`.
   - Exclude the current item: `dp[i - 1][w]`.
   We choose the maximum of these two.

5. **If weight is greater**: If the weight of the current item is greater than the current capacity, then we exclude the current item and take the value from the previous row.

6. **Return**: Finally, the function returns `dp[n][W]`, which represents the maximum value that can be obtained with all items and the given knapsack capacity.

Now, let's visualize how the dynamic programming table is built for the given problem instance:

```
Weight Capacity (W) ->   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10
  Items (n) â†“
      0                  0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0   0
      1                  0   0   0   0   0  10  10  10  10  10  10
      2                  0   0   0   0  40  40  40  40  40  50  50
      3                  0   0   0  30  40  40  40  40  40  50  70
      4                  0   0   0  50  50  50  50  90  90  90  90
```

Each cell in the table represents the maximum value that can be obtained using a subset of the items and a certain weight capacity. The values are calculated according to the rules described in the code.
