## Introduction

Data structures are essential components in computer science and programming. They provide a way to organize and store data efficiently, enabling efficient algorithms and operations. This repository aims to cover various data structures, along with code implementations and explanations.

## List of Data Structures

### Array

An array is a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. It is a basic and widely used data structure.

### Linked List

A linked list is a linear collection of elements where each element points to the next one in the sequence.

### Stack

A stack is a collection of elements with two main principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element.

### Queue

A queue is a collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

### Tree

A tree is a hierarchical data structure with a root element and subtrees of children with a parent node, representing a hierarchy.

### Graph

A graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges, representing relationships between the nodes.

### Hash Table

A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.

### Heap

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.

### Trie

A trie, also known as a digital tree or prefix tree, is an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array.

### Graph

A graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges, representing relationships between the nodes.
